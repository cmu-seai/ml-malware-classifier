# ml-malware-classifier



Starter code and some data, simplified from [Riccorl/ml-malware-classifier](https://github.com/Riccorl/ml-malware-classifier). To be used for an assignment in [SE4AI](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2020/).



The `preprocessed_data.txt` file contains already the summarized data from the medium dataset in this repository. A corresponding version for the full dataset can be found in the files section on Canvas.



The notebook `malware_analysis.ipynb` contains some simple code to load the data and learn a classifier.
